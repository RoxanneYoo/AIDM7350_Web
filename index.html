                    <p>Hello,my name is Liu Lujie, and my student number is 23467649.
                       I chose Duffy as my website topic mainly because Duffy has always 
                       been my favorite Disney character and one of Disney's popular IPs. 
                       He is very lively and cute, and his popularity and recognition 
                       make his an absolute must-have to attract a wide audience.

                    <p>Duffy Bear is a bear given to Mickey by Minnie. Minnie made a stuffed bear for Mickey who was about to 
                       go on a sea adventure. Minnie hoped that the bear would accompany Mickey so that Mickey would no longer 
                       be alone on the voyage.Mickey suggested calling this cute little bear Duffy (in Japanese, Duffy and 
                       backpack have similar pronunciations, trying to convey that Daffy and Mickey are inseparable). Since then, 
                       Duffy has been by Mickey's side, meeting many new friends along the way.</p>

                        In order to ensure that Mickey would not be alone when he traveled around the world, Minnie personally 
                        sewed this little bear for Mickey before his voyage to accompany him on his journey. After that, 
                        Minnie sewed a cute pink bear for Duffy and named her "Shirley Rose". From then on, Duffy and Shirley 
                        Rose became good friends as childhood sweethearts.

                    <p> Mickey and Duffy met Gerardoni in Italy when they were traveling around the world. When Duffy accidentally 
                        spilled the ice cream in his hand, Gerardoni cleverly dipped his tail into the ice cream that fell on the 
                        ground and made a picture. , made Duffy laugh out loud, and the two became good friends from then on. 
                        Under the influence of Geradoni, Duffy also quickly fell in love with painting. The two of them also gave each 
                        other their favorite works as gifts, and they had a deep affection for each other.
